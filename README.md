<h1 align="center">Open Galaxy</h1>
<p align="center">Galaxy client built only with open source software <i>except the UI</i></p>

## Purpose

I'm trying to prove the point that it's easy to do <sub>will see abou tthat</sub>

## How to get it

That's the tricky part, you don't.  
This project is made for educational purposes - me playing with Electron and trying to understand bundled angular code (LOL).

Even if it ever will be in usable state I'm not allowed to redistribute any parts of official Galaxy, so whole UI code.
